# This Movie app made with TMDB API, React, SCSS, Vite and Axios

While I was working on this project I've enjoyed the process and new technologies that I have recently learned. Vite is extremely fast, SCSS is very useful and it is easier than plain CSS,  
Axios is also is also a good library to know. I am beetwen fetch and axios sometimes one is better than another. But I recommend both as they are good to have.
React.js was initially confusing for me but with practice, 
it has become a useful and handy tool ( meybe just for me :) ).
